# Electric Vehicles Sales Analysis (India, 2014â€“2023)

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹
This project is all about analyzing electric vehicle (EV) sales data across India from 2014 to 2023. I used Python (with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to dig into a huge dataset and find out some cool trends about how EV adoption is growing in different states, vehicle types, and categories.
## Whatâ€™s in the Data?
- The dataset has over 96,000 rows and 8 columns.
- Covers all Indian states and union territories (34 regions).
- Tracks EV sales by:
  - Year and month
  - State
  - Vehicle class and category (like 2-Wheelers, 3-Wheelers, Buses, etc.)
  - Vehicle type
  - Number of EVs sold (EV_Sales_Quantity)
  
## What Did I Do?
- Loaded and cleaned the data: Checked for missing values, converted date columns, and made sure everything was ready for analysis.
- Explored the data: Got basic stats, like how many regions, vehicle classes, and categories are in the dataset.
- Visualized trends:
  - Yearly and monthly EV sales growth across India
  - State-wise EV sales comparisons
  - Sales by vehicle class and category
  - Vehicle type analysis

## How Did I Visualize the Data?
- Line plots to show EV sales trends over years and months.
- Bar plots to compare sales across states, vehicle classes, and categories.
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for all the charts to make the trends easy to spot.

## What Did I Learn?
- Thereâ€™s a massive increase in EV sales over the years, with some states leading the way.
- 2-Wheelers and 3-Wheelers are super popular in the EV space.
- Data cleaning and visualization are super important for making sense of big datasets.
  
## Why This Project?
I wanted to practice real-world data analysis, improve my Python skills, and learn how to turn raw data into insights that matter. This project helped me get better at:
- Data wrangling with Pandas
- Creating impactful visualizations
- Drawing conclusions from messy, real-world data
